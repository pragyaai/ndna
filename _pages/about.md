## Introduction to nDNA

**nDNA**—short for *Neural DNA*—is a novel framework for analyzing the latent cognitive structure of large AI models. Just as biological DNA governs inheritance in living systems, nDNA models the *semantic genome* of foundation models—mapping how they internalize, evolve, and transmit abstract patterns of thought, reasoning, and belief.

Rather than focusing solely on surface-level performance, nDNA dives into the internal epistemic geometry of models—revealing how they reason, adapt, and align with external values over time. It functions as a diagnostic fingerprint of a model’s evolving "mind."



## The Core Triad of nDNA

nDNA integrates three foundational signals to form a latent cognitive fingerprint of a model. Each component captures a distinct dimension of semantic dynamics:

### 1. **Spectral Curvature $$\kappa_\ell$$**  
**Definition**: Spectral measure of latent manifold bending and flexibility  
>**Interpretation**: Quantifies how sharply internal representational trajectories bend, serving as a scalar measure of latent acceleration. High curvature indicates regions where the model’s internal geometry undergoes rapid structural changes.

---

### 2. **Thermodynamic Length $$\mathcal{L}_\ell$$**  
**Definition**: Accumulated epistemic effort and adaptation energy  
>**Interpretation**: Reflects the computational work required for the model to reconcile existing beliefs with new input signals. This measure captures the “metabolic cost” of belief updating across the latent space.

---

### 3. **Belief Vector Norm $$\left\lVert v_\ell^{(c)} \right\rVert$$**  
**Definition**: Magnitude of directional force from cultural priors or alignment signals  
>**Interpretation**: Encodes where and how strongly external pressures (corpus-specific priors, alignment objectives) steer the latent representation space. Reduces complex vectorial dynamics to interpretable scalar magnitude.

## Why This Triad?

These three components—$$\kappa_\ell$$, $$\mathcal{L}_\ell$$, and $$\left\lVert v_\ell^{(c)} \right\rVert$$ — were selected for their minimal sufficiency and orthogonal coverage of model behavior:

- **$\kappa_\ell$**: Reflects intrinsic representational bending and flexibility  
- **$\mathcal{L}_\ell$**: Quantifies semantic effort or adaptation energy  
- **$\left\lVert v_\ell^{(c)} \right\rVert$**: Captures external value alignment and directional belief steering

This triad forms a complete **epistemic coordinate system**, enabling deeper insight into how foundation models adapt, evolve, and align under various training regimes.

## What nDNA Reveals

By analyzing nDNA scores across layers, we can identify:

- **Semantic instability**: where internal representations shift abruptly  
- **Cultural pressure zones**: where ideological influences alter reasoning  
- **Inheritance patterns**: how traits persist or mutate during training  
- **Model genealogy**: tracing lineage through latent cognitive fingerprints  
- **Alignment drift**: detecting unintended shifts in value or behavior

nDNA thus provides a unified framework to track, compare, and audit the internal evolution of foundation models.
